# Advent of Code 2023

https://adventofcode.com/2023

My attempts at completing these using Typescript. Mainly focusing on readability rather than efficiency or minimum number of characters.

I would like to use Typescript inference as much as possible, and make the code as easy to understand. There should be tests for most functions, and code visiblity. I will try to stick to a functional programming style of coding whilst trying to keep the code immutable, and functions should have 1 or as little responsilibility as possible

### Installation
